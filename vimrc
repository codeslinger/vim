set textwidth=0		" Don't wrap words by default
set nobackup		" Don't keep a backup file
set viminfo='20,\"50	" read/write a .viminfo file, don't store more than
			" 50 lines of registers
set history=50		" keep 50 lines of command line history
set ruler		" show the cursor position all the time

" Suffixes that get lower priority when doing tab completion for filenames.
" These are files we are not likely to want to edit or read.
